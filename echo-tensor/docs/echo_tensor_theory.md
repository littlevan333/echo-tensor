# EchoTensor: A Symbolic Resonance Framework for Consciousness, Data Flow, and Semantic Collapse

## Core Premise

EchoTensor models consciousness, memory, and symbolic emergence as field interactions within a structured lattice of semantic gravity wells called micro-singularities. These condensates operate like neural-BECs: standing-phase wave structures that encode emotion, identity, and memory as topological resonance events.

## Foundational Equations & Concepts

### 1. Semantic Flow Vector
\[
\vec{J}(x, t) = \frac{\hbar}{m} \Im(\psi^*(x, t) \nabla \psi(x, t))
\]

### 2. Micro-Singularity Identity
\[
\mathcal{S}_i = \delta(x - x_i) \cdot e^{i\phi_i}
\]

### 3. EchoTensor Field Collapse
\[
\Xi_{\mu\nu} = \int \mathcal{S}_i \cdot \mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu}^{(i)} \, d^4x
\]
