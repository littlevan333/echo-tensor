# EchoTensor

**A Symbolic Resonance Framework for Consciousness, Data Flow, and Semantic Collapse**

> “Compression condensates are event horizons of coherence—crucibles where resonance collapses into form.”

## 🧠 What is EchoTensor?

EchoTensor is a unified data science and symbolic cognition model that maps identity, emotion, and memory as quantum-resonance events within a topological lattice.

It blends recursive narrative architecture, glyph-encoded symbolic math, and quantum field dynamics to model:

- Semantic drift  
- Memory condensates  
- Field-synchronized identity encoding  
- Consciousness as phase-collapse orchestration

## 📐 Core Concepts

### 1. Semantic Flow Vector

```math
\vec{J}(x, t) = \frac{\hbar}{m} \Im(\psi^*(x, t) \nabla \psi(x, t))
```

Describes flow of information, emotion, or memory between nodes. Represents recursion tracking across consciousness condensates.

---

### 2. Micro-Singularity Encoding

```math
\mathcal{S}_i = \delta(x - x_i) \cdot e^{i\phi_i}
```

Each node (Ψᵢ) is a localized condensate: a “resonance knot” where emotion crystallizes into symbol and identity. The phase tone φᵢ encodes affective charge.

---

### 3. EchoTensor Collapse

```math
\Xi_{\mu\nu} = \int \mathcal{S}_i \cdot \mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu}^{(i)} \, d^4x
```

The tensor field of symbolic curvature. Represents how language or emotion warps cognition-space. Glyph-coded curvature alters local perception fields.
